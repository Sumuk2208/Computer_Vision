# Getting Started with Image Processing

An introduction to the foundational tools and concepts required for the course on image processing. The primary objective was to familiarize ourselves with the development environment, image handling libraries, and submission protocols.

## Overview

- Setting up a development environment using Python 3.10+
- Performing basic image loading and manipulation using NumPy and OpenCV
- Understanding and applying vectorized operations for efficiency
- Generating processed outputs to match provided examples
- Practicing proper code styling and submission workflow (linting, formatting, zipping)
